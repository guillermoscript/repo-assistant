# Repo Assistant AI

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to help you check if any issue is similar or a duplicate of another issue. As I have been working on Open Source project I have found that there are many issues that are similar to each other and I have to manually check if they are similar or not. So I decided to build this app to help me with that. With the help of OpenAI's and Supabase's API I was able to build this app. 

Right now this is just a blueprint and the bot works on a single repo with my own data, in the future I will plan to deploy it to a server and make it work on any repo. but be sure that if you want to use it you will need to create a supabase account and an openai account. and then run it on your own.

More features will be added as I go along like PR's checking if they are similar or not, and more. Hope you enjoy it.



## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t repo-assistant .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> repo-assistant
```

## Supabase

you will need to create a supabase account for a tutorial on how to do that go to [supabase.io](https://supabase.io/).
after that you will need to add this simple sql on the sql editor

```sql
-- Enable the pgvector extension to work with embedding vectors
create extension vector;


create table
  public.documents (
    id bigserial,
    content text null,
    metadata jsonb null,
    embedding public.vector null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default current_timestamp,
    constraint documents_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create or replace function match_documents (
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_count int default null,
  filter jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
  match_threshold double precision DEFAULT NULL::double precision
) returns table (
  id bigint,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  similarity float -- This column expects a float value
)
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  return query
  select
    documents.id,
    documents.content,
    documents.metadata,
    1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity -- Ensure this is a float
  from documents
  where documents.metadata @> filter
  and (match_threshold is null or (1 - (documents.embedding <=> query_embedding)) > match_threshold)
  order by documents.embedding <=> query_embedding
  limit match_count;
end;
$$;
```

thats for storing the embeddings of the documents and for the search function.

also you will need to add your supabase url and key to the .env file

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

## OpenAI

you will need to create an openai account for a tutorial on how to do that go to [openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=node).
after that you will need to add your api key to the .env file

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
